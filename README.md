# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview of Project
The objective of Credit Risk Analysis is to apply machine learning to solve the real world challenge of credit card risk. To achieve our goal we will use the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms to oversample the dataset. Afterwards, we will undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. In the end we will compare between the BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier to see which one reduces bias to predict credit risk.

## Summary
Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
