# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview of Project
The objective of Credit Risk Analysis is to apply machine learning to solve the real world challenge of credit card risk. To achieve our goal we will use the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms to oversample the dataset. Afterwards, we will undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. In the end we will compare between the BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier to see which one reduces bias to predict credit risk.
## Resources
**Source of Data** : LoanStats_2019Q1.csv 

**Software** : Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook,

## Results
Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.
- The RandomOverSampler has a balanced accuracy score of just under 66% with a predicted high risk of 73 and predicted low risk of 28. ![RandomOversamplingResults](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82983000/129909679-191b1836-c275-4cb5-9328-a468d9fe3225.png)

## Summary
Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
